Rabbit is a fun, peaceful life game where a rabbit feasts on grass to evolve into a mightier beast.

With a seemingly endless field of grass, and sometimes carrots around you, eat your way through the evolutionary cycle and prove Darwin wrong. The only thing that stands between you and world domination is your form factor, so go out there and evolve your way to the top.

Rabbit includes a score system in place for you to battle your friends to see who can get the highest score as well. Who is the best rabbit around?

This game was created by Mark Siminski as part of a game jam for Godot Engine.
